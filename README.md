# MyReads Project

This code is for a project from [Udacity's Front-End Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The goal of the project was to update a starter repository to create an app that keeps track of books via 3 shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read) and allows the user to move books between them, as well as add new books via a search facility. The search is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).

For more background, see the [original README](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/README.md).

The original repository was bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How to run
